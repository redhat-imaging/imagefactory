## Installation ##
1.  Q: How do I install image_factory?      
    A: The simplest approach is to install from rpm.  To read about creating the rpm and/or other installation options, please read the [INSTALL](https://github.com/aeolusproject/image_factory/blob/master/Documentation/INSTALL.markdown) document in the Documentation directory of source distribution.

## Configuration ##

    A: `/etc/imagefactory/imagefactory.conf`

2.  Q: Where does imagefactory log by default?      
    A: `/var/log/imagefactory.log`

3.  Q: Where does Image Factory put the images that are created?        
    A: There are really three parts to this answer...
    
    1. Image Factory stores a local copy of the image in the path pointed to by the configuration option `imgdir`, which defaults to `/var/tmp`
    2. Oz caches .iso files in `/var/lib/oz`
    3. If an Image Warehouse is configured and the JEOS was created by Image Factory, the resulting image is uploaded to the Image Warehouse in the `images` bucket.

        auth=no
