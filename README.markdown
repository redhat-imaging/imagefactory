#Image Factory#
*Your infrastructure in a sky full of clouds.*

Image Factory enables appliance creation and deployment to multiple virtualization
and Cloud providers.

##Features##
*   Build guest images for a growing list of operating system and cloud combinations.
    * Current guest OS support: Fedora 7-16, RHEL 5.x and 6.x
    * Current cloud support: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, VMware vSphere, Amazon EC2, Rackspace
*   Image Factory supports "build and upload" or snapshotting of existing images.
*   RESTful API makes integrating Image Factory into existing workflows simple.

##Using Image Factory##
Building an image begins with a template describing what to build. See an example
of such a template below. See the [schema documentation for TDL](http://aeolusproject.github.com/imagefactory/tdl/)
for more detail on creating a template. Note that a template is **not** tied to
a specific cloud. 

    <template>
        <name>f12jeos</name>
        <os>
            <name>Fedora</name>
            <version>12</version>
            <arch>x86_64</arch>
            <install type='iso'>
                <iso>http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/12/Fedora/x86_64/os/</iso>
            </install>
        </os>
    </template>

Next, use the imagefactory command and specify the template to use and for which
clouds to build an image. The above template example was saved to a file name f12_64.tdl.

    $ sudo imagefactory --template f12_64.tdl --target ec2

Once the image has been built, use the imagefactory command again, this time to
push the image into the cloud.

    $ sudo imagefactory --provider ec2-us-west-1 --credentials ec2_credentials.xml

That's it!  You can now launch an instance of this image using either the cloud
provider's management console or a cloud management tool such as 
**[Aeolus](http://www.aeolusproject.org/)**.

##Installing Image Factory##
Installing Image Factory is quick and easy.  Fedora 15-16 and RHEL 5-6 users can
add the Aeolus repository for either RHEL or Fedora as described on the
[Aeolus | Get It](http://www.aeolusproject.org/get_it.html#stable) page.  Once
configured, yum can be used to install Image Factory with:

    $ sudo yum install imagefactory

Other, unsupported, systems can install Image Factory using setuptools:

    $ git clone git://github.com/aeolusproject/imagefactory.git
    ...
    $ cd imagefactory
    $ sudo setup.py install
