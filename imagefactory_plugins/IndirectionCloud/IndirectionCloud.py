# This makes extensive use of parameters with some sensible defaults
# Try to keep an accurate list up here

# Parameter     -  Default - 
# Description

# utility_image - <base_image_id>
# Description: UUID of the image that will be launched to do the modification of the 
#              the base_image referenced in this target_image build.  Note that the 
#              utility image should itself be a base image and can, if constructed properly,
#              be the same as the base image that is being modified.  The plugin makes a copy
#              of the utility image before launching it, which allows safe modification during 
#              the target_image creation process.


# input_image_file - /input_image.raw (but only if input_image_device is not specified)
# Description: The name of the file on the working space disk where the base_image is presented

# input_image_device - None
# Description: The name of the device where the base_image is presented to the utility VM.
#              (e.g. vdc)

# NOTE: You can specify one or the other of these options but not both.  If neither are specified
#       you will end up with the default value for input_image_file.

# utility_cpus - None
# Description: Number of CPUs in the utility VM - this can also be set in the global Oz config
#              The lmc Live CD creation process benefits greatly from extra CPUs during the squashfs
#              creation step.  The performance improvement is almost perfectly O(n) w.r.t CPU.

# utility_customizations - None
# Description: A partial TDL document to drive the actions of the utility VM - only repos, packages,
#              files and commands will be used - all other content is ignored

# results_location - /results/images/boot.iso

# Description: Location inside of the working space image from which to extract the results.

# Borrowed from Oz by Chris Lalancette
